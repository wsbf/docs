------------------------------------------------------------------       
I. HOW WE RIP ARCHIVES
------------------------------------------------------------------       

Archiving is done locally in WSBF.  The computer known as John, located at 
130.127.17.39, accomplishes this through a piece of software known as Streamripper. 
 When active, Streamripper 'listens' to an audio stream (either local or via the web) 
 and writes the stream to an MP3 file on Disk.  It uses. by default, a naming scheme like 
 AAA-ZZZ.  By default, it records uninterrupted until it is told to stop.  When 
 it is told stop, it closes the file it is writing to, does some 'clean up' an quits.

Streamripper can be parameterized to have a different naming and recording behavior.  
This is done by providing a 'hook' into some data about what it is recording, 
typically a "title" and a "artist" for a track.  This is accomplished by giving 
streamripper access to another program which provides this 'metadata' about what 
Streamripper is recording.

We accomplish this at WSBF through the use of two scripts.  The first script is 
called streamripper.php.  It is located at http://new.wsbf.net/wizbif/streamripper.php .  
If you visit it, it will show you either

   title="#######" artist="" 
   OR
   artist="Yates Disgrace_" artist="#######_Shark Tank Block Party"

depending on whether or not I've fiddled with it lately.  This script basically 
says what show is currently happening on WSBF, and who the DJ is.

The other program is a Perl script called "fetch_external_metadata.pl" and lives
 on the computer known as John.  This program is run with a single input parameter, 
 notably a source which it pulls metadata from.  It checks the metadata every so 
 many seconds (5?).  Here's what the sample output from running this program looks 
 like:

      TITLE=20605
      ARTIST=
      .
      TITLE=20605
      ARTIST=
      .
      
When paired with Streamripper, it allows us to more dynamically take archives 
based on artist and title.  More simply put, Streamripper runs the 
fetch_external_metadata.pl script, and whenever it detects that either the title 
OR the artist has changed, it stops writing to the file it was writing to, and 
starts writing to a new file.  In short, you could use this to rip songs off of 
internet radio or something similar.  We use it to write a single show to a single
 mp3 file.

------------------------------------------------------------------       
II. HOW WE STORE ARCHIVES
------------------------------------------------------------------       
We store archives in a RAID-5 Array called BC_China that is locally attached to 
John.  BC_China contains four 1TB Caviar Black hard drives and has a total 
storage of 2.8TB.  Like all RAID-5 Arrays, has single-fault safety.  If a single 
hard-drive dies, no data loss occurs and we can safely keep operating.  If two 
hard drives die, we start to lose lots of data really quickly.

(NB: It is named after the Chinese tech support worker that Zach Musgrave spent 
many hours talking to in order to get it to function properly.) 

Currently, we have 3 distinct set of archives from 3 distinct eras at WSBF.  They 
are known as the archive, archives (with an s!) and archpk.  I'll talk about each of them 
separately, in chronological order.  In order to have less confusion, we'll give 
each of them nicknames:

New = archives
Old = archpk
OLDEST = archive

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. OLDEST
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

OLDEST is the oldest set of archives we have at WSBF.  The oldest archive in it 
has a creation date of February 2, 2008 (2/2/2008).  These are largely archives 
from the era of Ross Squire, the computer engineer before Zach Musgrave.  The 
most recent archive is May 30th, 2010 (5/30/2010).  Here's a breakdown of what 
OLDEST looks like size-wise:

5.3M    ./%/incomplete
5.3M    ./%
56K     ./forDeletion
3.7G    ./incomplete
0       ./rename
214G    .
214G    total

As you can see, there is a small amount of 'incomplete' archives in the incomplete 
folder.  We're not 100% sure how incomplete archives get created.  My best guess would be 
that we lost power while ripping an archive.

Most of the archives in OLDEST has the following naming format:

<DJ NAME0, DJ NAME1> - SHOW NAME (OPTIONAL) - Show Archive LONGFORM_DATE.

This format results in archives that look like the following:

Casey, Remy - Show Archive December 10, 2009.mp3
William Qualkinbush - Show Archive September 25, 2009.mp3
Joe Dubrowski - Tuesday Night Jam - Show Archive December 01, 2009.mp3

A few observations
-Some DJs are named only by their first name.  Casey, Remy refers to Casey 
McCaullaugh and Remy refers to Remembre Watts.
-Sometimes the full DJ name is used, as in Joe Dubrowski and William Qualkinbush.
-Sometimes the Show name is included.  Sometimes it is not.  I believe this was 
for shows that did not have show names.

They are not all in this format.  There are many anomalies:

1) There are a ton of shows that look like this:
      ld
2) There are some shows without a DJ name, or perhaps a DJ Pseudonym
   Rotating Specialty Show - Show Archive October 12, 2008.mp3
   Rush, Allan Babcock - Show Archive September 17, 2009.mp3
   Rush - Show Archive January 07, 2010.mp3
   Joe  - Show Archive January 25, 2009.mp3
   
3) There are a couple shows that have reversed order of names:
   Roots Rock Radio - Taylor Shoulders - Show Archive November 04, 2009.mp3
   
4) And then there are other weird anomalies
   -David Ballou--9540-.mp3
   , David Ballou - 9540.mp3
   , David Ballou - .mp3
   
5) As well as shows that we simply have no information on.  These shows amount 
to a small amount of space, ~500MB.
    -  (8).mp3
    -  (90).mp3
    -  (91).mp3
    -  (92).mp3
    -  (93).mp3
    -  (94).mp3
    -  (95).mp3
    -  (96).mp3
    -  (97).mp3
    -  (98).mp3
    -  (99).mp3
    -  (9).mp3

In total, I see roughly 4GB of shows that we can remove.

There are also at least 25 corrupted archives that follow the naming convention 
in 5).  They cannot be deleted, moved, touched, viewed, read, whatever.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IV. OLD
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
OLD is the folder known as archpk.  It is our largest set of archives.  It contains
archives between February 1, 2010 (2/1/2010) and July 10th, 2013 (7/10/2013).  
These are archives largely from the era of Zach Musgrave and David Cohen.

219G    ./incomplete
2.1T    .
2.1T    total

This is the lion share of our archives.  In totaly, it contains 219G of incomplete
archives, and 1.9TB of completed, good archives.

The archives only have 3 naming formats:

1) ####.mp3

This naming format refers to the ShowID in the database for the show.  Every show 
that happens on WSBF has a showID, and each new show gets the next sequential showId.

2) A##############.mp3

David Cohen informed me that the A stands for Automation.

There are more than likely other shows that use the first naming format that are 
also automation.

3) ####.mp3 (#)

These files are instances of a single show with multiple archives.  This could happen 
a number of ways, but the most likely way is that archiving crashed and recovered
 mid show, producing two files.  Another possibility is that archiving was manually
 stopped and started during a single show.
 
Within the Incomplete folder, we see a different story.  Incomplete is 219GB of 
files.  The files have the following naming format

1) Show Name, with <DJ0, DJ1, etc> - ShowID.mp3
   WSBF Radio Theater, with Abbey Normal - 17994 (10).mp3
   WSBF Radio Theater, with Abbey Normal - 17994 (11).mp3
   In the Mix, with Dominic Jones, Derek Riker - 17995 (15).mp3
   In the Mix, with Dominic Jones, Derek Riker - 17995 (16).mp3
   
2) Dj Name - ShowID.mp3
   Burrow - 13860 (7).mp3
   Burrow - 13860 (8).mp3
   Burrow - 13860 (9).mp3
   
3) Bad shows
    -  (47).mp3
    -  (48).mp3
    -  (49).mp3
    -  (4).mp3

4) There are also named automation archives that follows a sane naming format:
   The Best of WSBF, with Otto Mation - 18156.mp3
   
The majority of the files are 'duplicate' style files where we have multiple
archives for the same show.  In some cases, it is as many as 100+ files for the 
same show.  As I said before, the Incomplete archive is 219GB, here's some totals
for different types of files therein:

1) Bad Names: 54GB
2) Otto Mation: 130G

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
V. NEW
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The NEW set of archives are archives that happened under my watch.  They contain 
archives from Octobr 10th, 2013 (10/8/2013) and April 4th, 2014(4/28/2014).  It 
is a fairly small set of archives, coming in at ~200GB total.

5.8G    ./incomplete
206G    .
206G    total

This archive has one naming style:

1) <DJ0 DJ1 ...>_ - ShowID_Optional Show Name With Spaces.mp3
   Tyler Woody_ - 20130_.mp3
   Tyler Woody_Garrett Wilson_ - 19383_.mp3
   Wynne Morris_ - 18717_The Indie Gospel.mp3
   Wynne Morris_ - 18788_The Indie Gospel.mp3

In some cases, the show has a name, but due to a bug of some sort, there is no 
name on the file.  For example
   Otto Mation_ - 18863_.mp3

There are 20 very anomalous archives totalling 4.4MB of storage.  Insignificant.

Of the 200GB of archives in this folder, half of it (95GB) are Automation archives.

The incomlete folder is 5.8GB.  The vast majority of that folder is Automation archives.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
VI. WHAT ELSE IS WRONG?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are still a few more problems with BC_China and archiving.

1) BC_CHINA IS DYING!

That's not quite true.  Hardware wise, BC_China is fine.  We just replaced the 
dead hard drive in it, and no data loss occurred as a result.  However, the software
on BC_China is dying.  Every hard drive is formatted to a particular File System,
which is how the operating system interacts with the hard drive.  Different operating
systems support different file systems "natively".  Often, you can install a driver
to allow an operating system to interface with a hard drive that it does not natively support.

BC_China is formatted to the NTFS (New Technology File System) format.  NTFS is 
a Microsoft format for use in Windows operating system.  Originally, BC_China was
attached to the old Windows 2003 Server machine.  This made sense at the time.  
However, in our move to a more Linux-centric back-end, we never changed it over 
to a Linux compatible FileSystem.  However, I did install a driver that allows us 
to interface with NTFS format hard drives.  It is called NTFS-3G and is notoriously bad
at what it does.  It consumes significant amounts of processing power, and has a 
frequency to screw up writes to disk.  This has happened, and our file system is 
slowly becoming corrupt.

As a result, we cannot write files to BC_China.  We can temporarily record archives
to our other RAID-5 Array, ZAutoLib, which stores our digital music library, but 
it suffers from the same problem, being an NTFS formatted drive.

2) BC_CHINA IS RUNNING OUT OF SPACE!
We have enough space on BC_China for another year, roughly, of archives.  After 
that, it will be full.

/dev/sdc2       2.8T  2.5T  305G  90% /media/BC_China

3) WE HAVE NO WAY OF SERVING UP ARCHIVES!

Because we have ~12 different naming formats for archives, it is nearly impossible
to algorithmically (read, like a recipe) determine which file correspondes to which 
show, for all shows at WSBF.

4) ARCHIVING CRASHES, ISN'T REDUNDANT, IS NOT TRANSPARENT

Currently, archiving runs if someone sets it to run.  But if it crashes, no one 
knows unless the check John and see that it's running.  If it's not running, no 
one knows unless they check John to see if it's running.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
VII. HOW WILL WE FIX IT YATES?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This will be a multi-step process.  I would like to finish it this week if possible.

1) Dealing with the space issue.

I -NEED- some clarification on what level of archiving we would like to do.
1.1) How long should we keep archives?
1.2) Should we keep archives of automation?
1.3) What should we do with incomplete archives?
1.4) What should we do with archives that lack identifying information?

If we can delete items that qualify 1.2, we will free up roughly 400GB of space.
If we delete items that qualify 1.3, we can get another 300GB of space.
If we delete items that qualify 1.4, I lost count, but potentially another 50GB 
of space.

This would provide us a total of ~1TB of space, which would last the station 
another 3ish years.

2) Dealing with the file system issue.

If we can delete roughly 500GB of archives, I can move everything from BC_China 
to ZAutoLib an reformat BC_China to a file system format that is more reliable
and compatible with Linux (notably EXT4).  This is dangerous, as we do not have 
a backup of either ZAutoLib or BC_China, but I have no reason to believe that 
something will go wrong.

If we can acquire roughly 2.1TB of space, I can migrate everything off of BC_China
and reformat BC_China toa  file system format this is more reliable an compatible 
with Linux.  Again, dangerous, but no reason to believe that something will go wrong.
(Besides Murphy's Law).

The third alternative is that we can acquire corporate level cloud storage.  This
will not be a good solution for serving up archives, streaming music to automation,
but it is a good solution to our back up problem.  I was recently made aware of
a enterprise solution called Zendesk that offers unlimited cloud storage for 
~$800 a year.

3) Dealing with Naming Issues

This is a particularly tricky problem.  I would like to move all archives back 
to the naming scheme that was developed by David Cohen and contained in the 
archpk folder (aliased OLD).  That is simply showId.mp3. Those are the bulk of 
our archives, so there is less work to do. This makes files very easy to work 
with, the naming very elegant, and it links directly to our database.

Moving the archives that were taken under my watch (archives, NEW) will be easy,
because each archive has its showID in its name.

Moving the archives that were taken under Ross Squires watch (archive, OLDEST) will 
be hard.  We will have to cross-match the date and DJ with our data base logs of 
shows.  However, this is the least time critical piece.

4) Dealing with archiving and Reliability

I would like someone to develop a better solution for archiving.  This should 
be a very simple script that does the following:

   START:
      IS ARCHIVING RUNNING?
         IF YES, DO NOTHING
         IF NO, START RUNNING ARCHIVES
         WAIT 1 MINUTE
         GO TO START

We currently have a start of something like this, but, as always, it's very WSBF.

On John (130.127.17.39), there are two files, in two locations that deal with this.

/usr/bin/streamripper_start_on_boot
/usr/local/bin/streamripper_start_on_boot.sh

They do something similar to the top script.  They do not work correctly, I do 
not know what triggers them to fail, I do not know why we have two.  They 
could be salvaged.  They should probably be paired with Cron / Crontab for
ensuring that they never stop running.

I would also like someone to develop a watch dog script that determines whether 
or not this script is running.  It should have behavior that does the following:
   START:
      IS ARCHIVING RUNNING?
      IF YES, DO NOTHING
      IF NO, EMAIL COMPUTER ENGINEER, CHIEF ENGINEER, GENERAL MANAGER
      WAIT 1 MINUTE
      GO TO START  
      


5) Dealing with Automation Archives

Regardless of how we decide to handle archives of Automation, I would like to 
alter our meta-data script to indicate that a particular archive file was automated
radio play.  That way, in the future, it will be easy to identify logs that are 
automation.  Something like what was done under Zach and David's watch, where automation 
files are A#######.mp3.

6) Serving up archives

We need a method to serve up archives.  It should be very, very simple at first.
Here's what I'm envisioning

Drop Down Menu for DJ name.  Select DJ, hit submit, it provides you a list of 
all shows that DJ has done.  If an archive exists for a particular show, it 
provides a hyperlink to that archive.  If it does not, no hyperlink is provided.

Drop Down Menu for Show Name.  Select a show, hit submit, the webpage provides 
you a list of all shows that correspond to that show name.  If an archive exists 
for a particular show, it provides a hyperlink to that archive.  If it does not, 
no hyperlink is provided.

Calendar Widget for Date.  Select a date, hit submit, the webpage provides 
you a list of all shows that occured on that date.  If an archive exists 
for a particular show, it provides a hyperlink to that archive.  If it does not, 
no hyperlink is provided.

I believe this page would be easy enough for either Ben or Max to do.  It would
be stored on new.wsbf.net, our internal intranet, until we get some clear answer
on whether we can disseminate archives to the public.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
VIII. Summary
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since I am not a senior staff member, nor am I Jackie, I need a thumbs up go ahead
to do stuff before I do stuff.  And I need answers to the questions about what to do 
with archives above.

With that information, and ya'lls blessing, I can start on 1) and 2), and start 
thinking about 3) and 5).  David Cohen said he would look at 4 since his vacation 
turned into a bit of a bust. Someone else should handle 5).
